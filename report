Express.js Framework: 
I chose Express.js for building the API due to its simplicity, flexibility, and widespread use in the Node.js ecosystem. 

Data Storage: 
Dog facts are stored in a separate JavaScript file (dog_facts.js) to separate concerns and make the code more modular. 

Error Handling: 
Basic error-handling middleware is implemented 

One challenge was parsing the number of query parameters to determine the number of facts to return.
